description "You've made changes within a single file that belong to two different features, but neither of the changes are yet staged. Stage only the changes belonging to the first feature."

  puts "You might want to try to manipulate the hunks of the diff to choose which lines of the diff get staged. Read about the flags which can be passed to the `add` command; `git --help add`."
