Down in Louisiana in that sunny clime,
They play a class of music that is super fine,
And it makes no difference if its rain or shine,
You can hear that that jazz band music playing all the time.
It sounds so peculiar cause the music's queer.
How its sweet vibration seem to fill the air.
Then to you the whole world seems to be in rhyme.
You want nothing else but blues-band music all the time.

Ev'ry one that's nigh
Never seems to sigh,
Hear them loudly cry:
Hey!
