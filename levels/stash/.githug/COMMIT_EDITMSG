+Down in Louisiana in that sunny clime,
+They play a class of music that is super fine,
+And it makes no difference if its rain or shine,
+You can hear that that jazz band music playing all the time.
+It sounds so peculiar cause the music's queer.
+How its sweet vibration seem to fill the air.
+Then to you the whole world seems to be in rhyme.
+You want nothing else but jazz-band music all the time.
+
+Ev'ry one that's nigh
+Never seems to sigh,
+Hear them loudly cry:
+Oh!
