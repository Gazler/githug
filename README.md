# Githug
Git Your Game On 

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Gazler/githug.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Gazler/githug) [![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/Gazler/githug.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/github/Gazler/githug)

## About
Githug is designed to give you a practical way of learning git.  It has a series of levels, each requiring you to use git commands to arrive at a correct answer.

## Playing Githug

Githug should work on Linux, OS X and Windows.

### Prerequisites

Githug requires Ruby 1.8.7 or higher.

You can check which version of Ruby is installed with the following command:

```
ruby --version
```

If ruby is not installed, follow the installation instructions on [ruby-lang.org](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/).

### Installation

To install Githug, run

    gem install githug

If you get a complaint about permissions, you can rerun the command with `sudo`:

    sudo gem install githug

### Starting the Game

After the gem is installed change directory to the location where you want the game-related assets to be stored.
Then run `githug`:

    githug

You will be prompted to create a directory.

    No githug directory found, do you wish to create one? [yn]

Type `y` (yes) to continue, `n` (no) to cancel and quit Githug.

### Commands

Githug has 4 game commands:

 * play - The default command, checks your solution for the current level
 * hint - Gives you a hint (if available) for the current level
 * reset - Reset the current level or reset the level to a given name or path
 * levels - List all the levels

## Change Log

The change log is available on the wiki.  [Change log](https://github.com/Gazler/githug/wiki/Change-Log)

## Contributing

To suggest a level or create a level that has been suggested, check out [the wiki](https://github.com/Gazler/githug/wiki).

 Get yourself on the [contributors list](https://github.com/Gazler/githug/contributors) by doing the following:

 * Fork the repository
 * Make a level in the levels directory (covered below)
 * Add your level to the LEVELS array inside `lib/githug/level.rb` in a position that makes sense (the "commit" level after the "add" and "init" levels for example)
 * Make sure your level works (covered below)
 * Submit a pull request

## Todo List

 * A follow-up to the level, more information on a specific command, etc.
 * More levels!

## Writing Levels

Githug has a DSL for writing levels. Here is an example:

```ruby
difficulty 1
description "There is a file in your folder called README, you should add it to your staging area"

setup do
  repo.init
  FileUtils.touch("README")
end

solution do
  return false unless repo.status.files.keys.include?("README")
  return false if repo.status.files["README"].untracked

  true
end

hint do
  puts "You can type `git` in your shell to get a list of available git commands"
end
```

 `difficulty`, `description` and `solution` are required.

You can include multiple hints like this:

```ruby
hints [
  "You can type `git` in your shell to get a list of available git commands",
  "Check the man for `git add`"]
```

 By default, `setup` will remove all files from the game folder.  You do not need to include a setup method if you don't want an initial git repository (if you are testing `git init` or only checking an answer.)

 You can call `repo.init` to initialize an empty repository.

 All methods called on `repo` are sent to the [grit gem](https://github.com/mojombo/grit) if the method does not exist, and you can use that for most git related commands (`repo.add`, `repo.commit`, etc.).

Another method exists called `init_from_level` and it is used like so:

```ruby
setup do
  init_from_level
end
```

This will copy the contents of a repository specified in the levels folder for your level.  For example, if your level is called "merge" then it will copy the contents of the "merge" folder.  It is recommended that you perform the following steps:

 * mkdir "yourlevel"
 * cd "yourlevel"
 * git init
 * some git stuff
 * **important** rename ".git" to ".githug" so that it isn't treated as a submodule
 * cd "../"
 * git add "yourlevel"

After doing this, your level should be able to copy the contents from that git repository and use those for your level.  See the "blame" level for an example of this.

## Testing Levels

The easiest way to test a level is:

 * Change into your git_hug repository
 * Run `githug reset PATH_TO_YOUR_LEVEL`
 * Solve the level
 * Run `githug test PATH_TO_YOUR_LEVEL`

Please note that the `githug test` command can be run as `githug test --errors` to get an error stack trace from your solve method.

It would be ideal if you add an integration test for your level.  These tests live in `spec/githug_spec` and **must** be run in order.  If you add a level but do not add a test, please add a simple `skip_level` test case similar to the `contribute` level.
